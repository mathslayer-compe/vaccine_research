This study analyzes vaccination data from five studies conducted over five years to understand patterns in antibody responses. Antibody levels were measured before and after vaccination, and the data were categorized by study year, subject participation (one-year vs. multi-year), age groups, and cross-reactivity. Key questions addressed include improvement rates in antibody response, the impact of multiple study participation, age-group differences, and cross-reactivity trends. Results revealed that 79.84% of subjects improved, with higher improvement in one-year participants (84.67%) compared to multi-year participants (77.23%). Improvement patterns varied across age groups, and the highest cross-reactivity was observed in the 2021 study.
